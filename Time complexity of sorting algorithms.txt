Time complexity:
Selection sort O(n^2)
Bubble          O(n^2)
Insertion       O(n^2)
Heap            O(nlogn)
Quick           O(n^2)
Merge           O(nlogn)
Bucket          O(n^2)
Radix           O(n^2)

efficiency

O(1)> O(logn) O(n) O(nlogn) O(n^2) O(!n)

Space complexity:
merge sort takes more Space and bubble sort don't take much space
